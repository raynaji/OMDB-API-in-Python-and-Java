# OMDB-API-in-Python-and-Java
In this project, I began with a small API exercise using Number API. 

The second part is getting information of movies from OMBD through its API. Then created a database on the local to store all these information. 

The OMDB part is also achieved in Java.  
Main Take-away:
 * how to connect to database in java.  
 * compare strings: string.contentEquals().  
 * URL encode: URLencoder.encode().  
 * Convert string into number data types:   
 * Convert number yupes into String:  
 * Express decimals in java: Float imdb_rating = .25f;
